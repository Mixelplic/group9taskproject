# group9taskproject
This is a project developed for completion of the Generation USA Junior Web Development program

While coding this project, I learned how CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications work with JavaScript, how to style Modals, CSS Media Quieries, CSS Box Model, and CSS positioning. 

The following modifications were made to the original code:
- adding a TASK STATUS necessary for user to decide how to manage his/her task
- displaying a user's NAME next to the task for whom it is assigned
- displaying a DUE DATE for the task
- altering background images, button styles, and fonts

I enjoyed working on this project. I was able to also utilize Font Awesome, Google Fonts, Bootstrap and Popper for additional styling.
